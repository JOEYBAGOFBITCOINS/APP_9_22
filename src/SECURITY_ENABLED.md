# 🔒 Security Enabled - FuelTrakr is Production-Secured!

## ✅ What Just Changed

### Domain Restriction: **ENABLED** ✓

**File Updated:** `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`
- Changed `ENFORCE_NAPLETON_DOMAIN` from `false` → `true` (Line 8)

## What This Means

### ✅ NOW PROTECTED:
- ✅ Only **@napleton.com** email addresses can sign up
- ✅ Unauthorized emails will be rejected with error message
- ✅ App is secured for Napleton employees only

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

**Demo Accounts Still Work:**
- `admin@napleton.com` / `admin123`
- `porter@napleton.com` / `porter123`

These are pre-created and will continue working.

**New User Signup:**
- ✅ **john.smith@napleton.com** → Will work
- ❌ **john.smith@gmail.com** → Will be rejected
- ❌ **competitor@otherdealership.com** → Will be rejected

## Next Steps (Recommended)

### 1. **Redeploy the Backend** (Required)
The backend change needs to be deployed to Vercel:

```bash
# In your terminal
vercel --prod
```

Or push to your Git repository if auto-deploy is configured.

### 2. **Change Demo Passwords** (Security)
Since you're live, change these ASAP:

1. Sign in as `admin@napleton.com` / `admin123`
2. Go to your Supabase dashboard
3. Change the password for both accounts

### 3. **Optional: Add Environment Variable**
While the code is already secure, you can also set this in Vercel for consistency:

**Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:**
- Name: `VITE_REQUIRE_NAPLETON_EMAIL`
- Value: `true`

## Testing the Security

Try signing up with a non-Napleton email:
- ❌ Should see: "Only Napleton email addresses are allowed"

Try signing up with a Napleton email:
- ✅ Should work: Account created successfully

## Current Status

🟢 **LIVE & SECURED**
- URL: https://escape-plan-two.vercel.app/
- Domain restriction: **ENABLED**
- Console logging: **OFF**
- Demo mode: **OFF**
- Ready for production use

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to disable domain restriction:

1. Edit `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`
2. Change line 8: `const ENFORCE_NAPLETON_DOMAIN = false;`
3. Redeploy
